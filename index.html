                Slovakia is a mountainous country,
                crisscrossed by many rivers and
                dotted with several lakes. Several of
                the pristine nature areas in Slovakia
                are classified as UNESCO World
                Biosphere Reserves in order to

                more and get some new information
                about Slovak history. I want to focus
                mainly on sightseeing and places
                associated with art, galleries, museums
                and castles. There are more than
                100 castles and at least double this
                number of manor houses built in
                different historical eras.
